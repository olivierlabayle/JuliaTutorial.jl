# JuliaTutorial

## Before the day

Please try to complete the two following sections before the tutorial so that we can make the most of your time. If you have any problem please let me know so that we can fix it before the date.
### Installation 

- Installing Julia: Visit [the Julia installation page](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) and follow the instructions associated with your platform. Check your installation by typing `julia` in a terminal from wherever you are and the REPL should appear.
- Installing VSCode: This is not strictly necessary but highly recommended. Visit [the VScode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the installation instructions.
- Installing the Julia Extension in VSCode: VScode is a lightweight editor that works with plugins. We will need the [Julia plugin](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/#Installation-and-Configuration-1), to install it just look for "Julia" in VSCode's extension panel (on the left).
- Clone this repository and open it with VScode
### Taming VScode

A complete list of usual shortcuts can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) for reference.

The most useful one is the command palette:

`Ctrl+Shift+P, F1: Show Command Palette`

then you can type to look for any functionality. For instance, type "Terminal" and select "Create new terminal" and a terminal should appear at the bottom of the screen.

We will be mostly using in 3 VSCode Julia's shortcuts, to find them, from the command palette type:

- "julia start": locate "Start REPL" and try the associated shortcut, the REPL should appear at the bottom of the screen.
- "julia line": locate "Send current line or selection to REPL" and try the associated shortcut with the following line (put the cursor on it):
a = 1
- "julia stop": locate "Stop REPL" and try the associated shortcut.

Well done you are now a VSCode power user!
